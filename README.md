<h4 align="center">A simple app to keep a track of things, something I originaly made for a school project.</h4>

<p align="center">
Keep track of your slideshow ice breakers with toggle buttons to keep track of which questions have been selected and maybe a counter for keeping track of points of teams or individuals. Or keep your games organized with the same counter for points and a timer for a fair time-based round. And with different card groups, you can keep a history of these cards and take a look back easily. This app aims to help you keep atop of multiple things easier, all in one place, with a pleasing interface.
